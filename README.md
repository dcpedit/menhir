## Plate
`Menhir_PlasticPlate.ai` - Switch plate with leaf-mounts removed.  Intended for lasercutting 1.5mm arylic.

## Firmware
Source code is located in the `menhir` branch of my QMK fork:

https://github.com/dcpedit/qmk_firmware/tree/menhir/keyboards/fruitykeeb/menhir

`firmware/menhir_default.hex` - Port to QMK
`firmware/menhir_via.hex` - Port to VIA
`firmware/menhir_via.json` - VIA JSON file

## Original
Files in the `stock` directory were downloaded directly from the Fruitykeeb discorder server: https://discord.gg/aD3mec3xP2
